I'm a trained computational immunologist, interested in understaning the immune system's response to infections and vaccinations. My current research involves analysing systems serological, scRNAseq, and snATC-seq data to identify pre-vaccination correlates of  pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccines in older adults. Ultimately, I aim to discover blood biomarkers that can effectively differentiate between vaccine responders and non-responders.
