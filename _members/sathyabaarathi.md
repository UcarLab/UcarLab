 I am a computational immunologist, specifically interested in understanding immune system's response to acute infections and immunization. Presently, my work entails analyzing serological, scRNAseq, and snATC-seq data to identify baseline correlates of pneumococcal and seasonal influenza vaccine responses in older adults.
