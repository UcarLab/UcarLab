In collaboration with [the Stitzel lab](https://www.jax.org/research-and-faculty/research-labs/the-stitzel-lab) we study genomic and epigenomic profiles in human islets and changes in these profiles associated with Type-2-Diabetes (T2D). For this we profile epigenomes/transcriptomes of human islet samples from healthy and diabetic individuals to uncover genomic signatures of T2D. We also integrate these data with genotypes of individuals via QTL analyses to uncover to what extent islet functions and responses are genetically modulated.
