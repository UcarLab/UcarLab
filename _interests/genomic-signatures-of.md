The functional decline of the immune system with aging, i.e., immunosenescence, has been associated with increased disease susceptibility, infections, and poor response to treatments and vaccination in elderly. However, we have yet to discover which genes, enhancers and regulatory interactions in which immune cells can explain the functional decline of immune functions with aging and whether these changes are similar between sexes and different populations. In collaboration with Banchereau Lab and [UCHC](https://health.uconn.edu/aging/) Center on Aging we study chromatin signatures of human immune system aging and to quantify the clinical implications of these signatures.
