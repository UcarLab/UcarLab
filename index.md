# Knowledge is power, use it wisely!

The Ucar Lab at Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine studies the dynamics of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in human cells to uncover how these patterns are disrupted with aging in immune cells and with Type 2 Diabetes in pancreatic islet cells. We develop [computational pipelines and methods](https://github.com/UcarLab) to analyze and integrate diverse genomics data from human cells.
