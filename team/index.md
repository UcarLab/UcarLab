#### Bioinformatics Analyst II

Bioinformatics Analysts work under the supervision of the PI, research scientist, or department head, to analyze complex bioinformatics research. Typical projects include, but are not limited to: all classes of High Throughput Sequence (HTS) data analysis (DNA Seq, mRNA Seq, ChIP Seq, micro RNA Seq etc); experimental design; data integration; algorithm development; statistical analysis of data; development of workflows and implementing new analytical methods; evaluation/testing of software/database systems, analytical tools and technology; user interface, data, and functional requirements for software/database systems involving significant biological content; and delivering training to the research community.  Characteristic distinctions from level I to level III include increased ability to work independently, increased breath of bioinformatics knowledge and tools, and increased understanding of the biological research domains. Level III analysts may pursue limited co-pi collaborations with research faculty. Senior/Lead supervises other bioinformatics employees and leads and manages bioinformatics projects, and may serve as co-pi to research faculty.
